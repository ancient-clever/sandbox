  <p>A field for the minesweeper game is a grid <span class="math-tex">\( n \times m \)</span> in size. The cell of the grid may or may not contain a mine. </p> 
  <p>Write a program that outputs "solved" field, i.e., for each cell, which is not a mine, it indicates the number of mines in the neighbouring cells (including diagonal directions)</p> 
  <p><b>Input format:</b><br> The first line contains two natural numbers <span class="math-tex">\( 1 \le n,m \le 100 \)</span>, after which the <span class="math-tex">\( n \)</span> lines contain a description of the field in the form of a sequence of dots '.' and asterisks '*', where the dot denotes an empty cell, and the asterisk â€“ the cell with a mine.</p> 
  <p><b>Output format:</b><br> <span class="math-tex">\( n \)</span> lines of the field, each cell of which will contain either a number from 0 to 8, or a mine (marked by "*"), wherein any number means the number of mines in the neighbouring cells.</p>
