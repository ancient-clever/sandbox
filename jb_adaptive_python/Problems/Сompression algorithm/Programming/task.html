  <p>Upon learning that DNA is not a random string, freshmen of the Bioinformatics Institute from the informatics group suggested using a compression algorithm that compresses repeated characters in a string.</p> 
  <p>Encoding is performed as follows:<br> s = 'aaaabbсaa' is converted into 'a4b2с1a2', that is, the groups of the same characters of the input string are replaced by the symbol and the number of its repetitions in this string.</p> 
  <p>Write a program, which reads the string, encodes it by this algorithm and outputs the encoded sequence. Encoding must <b>be</b> case sensitive.</p>
