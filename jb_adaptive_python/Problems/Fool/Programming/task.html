  <p>During calculations, the card values are used as described above: 6 has the lowest value, and ace - the highest.</p> 
  <p>Write a program, which decides whether one cards beats another one.<br> </p> 
  <p>If there are two cards of the same suit, wins the one having the higher face value;<br> If the cards belong to the different suits, wins the one having the trump suit;<br> If the cards belong to the different suits and there are no cards from the trump suit, nobody wins.</p> 
  <p><b>Input format:</b><br> First line specifies the two cards in the <b>&lt;value&gt;&lt;suit&gt;</b> format separated by a space, and the next line specifies the trump suit.</p> 
  <p><b>Output format:</b><br> The program should output a single word:<br></p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>First</b><span>, if the first card beats the second one,&nbsp;</span><br></li>
   <li><b>Second</b><span>, if the second card beats the first one,</span><br></li>
   <li><b>Error</b><span>, if none of the cards can beat the other one.</span><br></li>
