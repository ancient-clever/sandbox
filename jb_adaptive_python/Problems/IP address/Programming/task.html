  <p>In the internet, each computer is assigned a four-byte code (IP address), which is usually written as four numbers, each of which can take the values from 0 to 255, separated by periods. Below are the examples of the correct IP addresses: <br> 127.0.0.0<br> 192.168.0.1<br> 255.0.255.255</p> 
  <p>Write a program to determine whether the specified string is a correct IP address.</p> 
  <p>The program should take a string of arbitrary characters as input.<b> </b>If this string is a correct record of an IP address - output YES, otherwise - output NO.</p> 
  <p><b>Note</b></p> 
  <p>In order to convert string to number it is convenient to use the int function, which takes one string as an argument and returns a number.</p>
