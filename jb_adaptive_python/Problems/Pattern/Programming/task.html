  <p>The simplest example of a pattern is a string that contains the characters that we want to find. For example, the string "abc" is the pattern for the string "abc", thus</p>
  <pre><code>import re
results = re.findall("abc", "abcAbcabc")
print(results)</code></pre>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div> 
   <p>Outputs all occurrence of the string "abc" in the string "abcAbcabc"</p> 
   <p>In this problem, you get text as an input. By using regular expressions you need to find all occurrences of the "you" substring in it and output their number.</p> 
   <p>NB. In this problem, you should also consider the case of letters.</p> 
   <p>NB. In this problem,you can use the following code to read the standard input:</p> 
  </div>
  <br>
  <pre><code class="language-python">import sys
data = sys.stdin.read()</code></pre>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   as the text inside the test may consist of multiple lines, and input() reads line by line. 
   <br>
  </div>
