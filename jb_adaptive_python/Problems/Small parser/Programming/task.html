  <p>Write a program that parses user commands and imitates their processing.</p> 
  <p>The program should output messages on its state in the following format:<br> When user enters a command, the content of which we denote as <b>&lt;command&gt;</b>, the program should print the phrase</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Processing "&lt;command&gt;" command...</code></pre>
  <p>For example, a user has entered <b>Come to me</b>, in this case the following line should be printed<br></p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Processing "Come to me" command...</code></pre>
  <p>Reading of commands shall continue until the <b>End</b> command is entered, in such case the program should print the message</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Good bye!</code></pre>
  <p>and end (see the example).</p> 
  <p>Use the <b>input()</b> function without arguments to read the commands.</p> 
  <p><b>Input format:</b><br> A sequence of commands, each on a separate line. A command consists of the letters of Latin alphabet, spaces and tab symbols. It is guaranteed that there are no spaces at the beginning and at the end of a line. <b>End</b> is always the last command.</p> 
  <p><b>Output format:</b><br> Messages while processing of commands, as specified in the problem statement; one message per line.</p>
