  <p><b>Character by character match</b></p> 
  <p>The simplest example of a pattern is a string that contains the characters that we want to find. For example, the "<b>abc</b>" string is the pattern for the "<b>abc</b>" string, thus</p>
  <pre><code>import re
results = re.findall("abc", "abcAbcabc")
print(results)</code></pre>
  <div> 
   <p><br>Outputs all the occurrences of the "<b>abc</b>" string in the "<b>abcAbcabc</b>" string.</p> 
   <p>In this problem the input is text. Using regular expressions, find all occurrences of the "<b>you</b>" substring in it and display its number.</p> 
   <p>NB. This problem is case-sensitive.</p> 
   <p>NB. For the correct reading of the standard input in this problem you need to use the </p> 
  </div>
  <br>
  <pre><code class="language-python">import sys
data = sys.stdin.read()</code></pre>
  <div> 
   <p><br>Since the text can have multiple lines, and input() reads on a by-line basis.</p>
  </div>
