  <p>One of the applications of multiple inheritance â€“ extension of the class functionality in some pre-defined way. For example, if we need to log some information during class method invocation.</p> 
  <p>Let use review the <b>Loggable</b> class:</p>
  <pre></pre>
  <pre></pre>
  <pre><code class="language-python">import time
class Loggable:
    def log(self, msg):
        print(str(time.ctime()) + ": " + str(msg))</code></pre>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div> 
   <p>It has the exactly one method <b>log</b>, which allows outputting to the log (in this case in stdout) some message, adding the current time.<br> </p> 
   <p>Implement the class <b>LoggableList</b>, inheriting it from the classes <b>list </b>and <b>Loggable</b>, so that when adding an element to the list using the <b>append</b>&nbsp;method, the message containing the just added element would be sent to the log.</p> 
   <p><b>Note</b><br> Your program should not contain the <b>Loggable </b>class. Your program will have this class available during the check, and it will contain the <b>log</b> method, described above.</p>
  </div>
