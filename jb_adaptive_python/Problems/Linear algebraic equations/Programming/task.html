  <p>Write a program that solves system of linear algebraic equations by the Gaussian method.</p> 
  <p><b>Input data format: </b></p> 
  <p>The first line specifies two numbers: the number of equations <span class="math-tex">\( n \)</span> (<span class="math-tex">\( n \ge 1 \)</span>) and the number of indeterminates <span class="math-tex">\( m \)</span> (<span class="math-tex">\( m \ge 1 \)</span>). Next goes n number of lines, each of which contains the m+1 number. First m numbers are the coefficients of the i-th equation of the system, and the last, (m+1) number is the coefficient <span class="math-tex">\( b_i \)</span>, placed in the right part of the i-th equation.</p> 
  <p><b>Output data format:</b></p> 
  <p>The first line should output the word YES, if the solution exists and it is the only one, the word NO if the solution does not exist, and the word INF in case if there are infinitely many solutions. If the solution exists and it is the only one, you should provide the solution of the simultaneous linear algebraic equations in the form of m numbers in the second line, separated by a space.</p>
