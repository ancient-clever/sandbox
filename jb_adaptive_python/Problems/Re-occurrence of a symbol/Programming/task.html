  <p>In this problem, we will look how to implement re-occurrence of a symbol using regular expressions.</p> 
  <p>We may use the three various constructions to implement the repeat:</p> 
  <p>1. &nbsp; Wildcards { }, inside which we can place the minimum/maximum number of repeats that we are satisfied with, or the exact number of repeats that we are looking for. For example, the pattern "A{3, 5}" will fit all substrings, consisting of consecutive characters А, with length from 3 to 5, and the pattern "T{4}" will fit only those substrings, which contain 4 T in a row.</p> 
  <p>2. &nbsp; Wildcard *. This wildcard means any number of occurrences of a character (or a group of characters): from zero to any number you want. Thus, the pattern "A*" fits all sequences, consisting of any number of consecutive А, and fits an empty string (as zero also fits).</p> 
  <p>3. &nbsp; Wildcard +. This wildcard means any positive number of occurrences of a character (or a group of characters): from zero to any number you want. This way, the pattern "A+" fits all sequences, consisting of any number of consecutive А. Unlike "А*", the empty string will not fit.</p>
  <p> All repeat meta characters are applied to a character after which they occur (or group of characters).</p> 
  <p>Examples of usage:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">import re
results = re.findall("A+", "AAATATAGCGC")
print(results)
results = re.findall("TA{2}", "AATATAGCGTATA")
print(results)</code></pre>

  <p>Given the list of phone numbers (each line contains one phone number). Your task is to check whether these phone numbers are "cool": a phone number is called "cool", if it contains 3 or more same digits in a row. For example, number 19992034050 is a "cool" one, but 19500237492 is not.</p> 
  <p>Your task is to leave only the cool numbers: the standard output should contain "cool" numbers, each number on a separate line.</p>
