  <p>Implement a data structure that represents an extended stack. It is necessary to support the pushing (appending) of the element to the top of the stack, the popping (removal) from the top of the stack, and also the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and integer division.</p> 
  <p>The operation of addition on the stack is defined as follows. The top element (<b>top1</b>) is removed from the stack, then the next top element (<b>top2</b>) is removed, and then the element equal to <b>top1 + top2 </b>is pushed to the stack.</p> 
  <p>In similar way are defined the operations of subtraction (<b>top1 - top2)</b>, multiplication (<b>top1 * top2</b>) and integer division (<b>top1 // top2</b>).</p> 
  <p>Implement this data structure as the <b>ExtendedStack</b> class, by inheriting it from the standard <b>list</b> class.<br> The required class structure:</p>
  <pre><pre><code class="language-python">class ExtendedStack(list):
    def sum(self):
        # addition
    def sub(self):
        # substraction
    def mul(self):
        # multiplication
    def div(self):
        # integer division</code></pre>&nbsp;</pre> 
  <b>
   <div>
    <b> <p><b>Note </b>Use the <b>append</b> method to push an element to the stack, and the <b>pop</b> method - to remove it. It is guaranteed that the extended operations will be requested only if the stack contains at least two elements.</p></b>
