  <p>Tower of Hanoi is one of the well-known puzzles with the following rules.</p> 
  <p>Given three rods (let's number them as 1, 2 and 3). The first rod has <span class="math-tex">\( n \)</span> rings on it with radius from 1 to <span class="math-tex">\( n \)</span>. Rings are ordered by radius, and the largest of the rings lies below all others.</p> 
  <p>You should write an algorithm to move all <span class="math-tex">\( n \)</span> rings from the first rod to the third rod, sticking to the following rules: <br></p>
  <ol>
   <li>Only one disk can be moved at a time.<br></li>
   <li>No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.<br></li>
  </ol> 
  <p>The program should output the shortest sequence of actions required to move all the rings from the first rod to the third one.</p> 
  <p><b>Input format:</b><br> A positive integer <span class="math-tex">\( n \)</span>.</p> 
  <p><b>Output format:</b><br> The list of moves to solve the puzzle. Each move should be written in a separate line in the format &nbsp;"<i>number of the rod from which we remove the ring</i>" - "<i>number of the rod, on which we put the ring</i>"<br>(see example)</p>
