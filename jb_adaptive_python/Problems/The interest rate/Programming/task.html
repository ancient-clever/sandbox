  <p>The interest rate on the deposit is P percent per annum, which are added to the deposit amount after one year. The deposit is X dollars Y cents. Find the size of the deposit in K years.</p> 
  <p><b>Input data format</b></p> 
  <p>Integers P, X, Y, K.</p> 
  <p><b>Output data format</b></p> 
  <p>The program should output two numbers: the size of the deposit in K years in dollars and cents. Fractional parts of cents after a year should be discarded. Recalculation of the deposit amount (discarding the fractional parts of cents) occurs annually.</p> 
  <p><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>If you are facing issues with accuracy in this problem â€“ try to solve it using only integer numbers.</p>
