  <p>There is an implemented function <span class="math-tex">\( f(x) \)</span>, accepting an integer number <span class="math-tex">\( x \)</span> as input, which calculates some integer value and returns it as a result of the operation.</p> 
  <p>The functions is calculated rather long, does not print anything, does not write anything into files and depends only on the argument <span class="math-tex">\( x \)</span>.</p> 
  <p>Write a program, the first line input of which contains the <span class="math-tex">\( n \)</span> number â€” the amount of <span class="math-tex">\( x \)</span> values, for which you need to find out the value of the function <span class="math-tex">\( f(x) \)</span>, then the <span class="math-tex">\( n \)</span> values themselves, each on the separate line. <i>After each</i> entered argument value, the program should output the corresponding values of the <span class="math-tex">\( f \)</span> function on the separate line. </p> 
  <p>To speed up the computation <b>necessary to save</b> already calculated values of the function under certain known arguments.</p> 
  <p>Note that in this problem has a strong limit of two seconds on the code execution time on each test.</p>
