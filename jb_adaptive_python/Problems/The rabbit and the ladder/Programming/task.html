  <p><b>The rabbit and the ladder</b></p> 
  <p>The rabbit appeared in the Zoo. He was placed in a cage, and the Director of the Zoo ordered to put a ladder in his cage, so that he could entertain himself. Now our rabbit can jump up the ladder, jumping over the steps. The ladder has the particular number of stairs <span class="math-tex">\( N \)</span>. In one jump the rabbit can jump over not more than <span class="math-tex">\( К \)</span> steps. To make it more fun, the rabbit each time tries to find a new way to the top of the ladder. The Director is interested in how many different ways does the rabbit have to reach the top of the ladder for a given values <span class="math-tex">\( K \)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\( N \)</span>. Help the Director to write a program that will compute this number. </p>
  <p>For example, if K=3 and N=4, the following ways exist: 1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 1+2+1, 2+1+1, 2+2, 1+3, 3+1. Therefore for the given values the rabbit has only 7 different ways to reach the top of the ladder.</p> 
  <p><b>Input data</b></p> 
  <p>The single line contains the two integers <span class="math-tex">\( K \)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\( N \)</span> <span class="math-tex">\( (1 \le K \le N \le 300) \)</span>. <span class="math-tex">\( К \)</span> - the maximum number of steps, which rabbit can overcome in one jump, <span class="math-tex">\( N \)</span> – the total number of the steps.</p> 
  <p><b>Output data</b></p> 
  <p>Output a single integer – number of different ways the rabbit can reach the top of the ladder, without leading zeros.</p>
