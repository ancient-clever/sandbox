  <p>It is legal for one function to call another; it is also legal for a function to call itself. It may not be obvious why that is a good thing, but it turns out to be one of the most magical things a program can do. For example, look at the following function:&nbsp;<br></p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">def&nbsp;countdown(n):
  if n&lt;= 0:  
      print ('Blastoff!')
  else :
      print&nbsp;(n)
      countdown(n-1)</code></pre>
  <p>If <span class="math-tex">\( n \)</span> is 0 or negative, it outputs the word, “Blastoff!” Otherwise, it outputs <span class="math-tex">\( n \)</span> and then calls a function named <span class="math-tex">\( countdown \)</span>—itself—passing <span class="math-tex">\( n-1 \)</span> as an argument. What happens if we call this function like this?&nbsp;<br></p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; contdown(3)</code></pre>&nbsp;
  <div>
   The execution of 
   <span class="math-tex">\( countdown \)</span> begins with 
   <span class="math-tex">\( n=3 \)</span>, and since n is greater than 0, it outputs the value 3, and then calls itself...&nbsp;
  </div>
  <div>
     The execution of 
   <span class="math-tex">\( countdown \)</span> begins with 
   <span class="math-tex">\( n=2 \)</span>, and since n is greater than 0, it outputs the value 2, and then calls itself...&nbsp;
   <br>    &nbsp; &nbsp;﻿The execution of 
   <span class="math-tex">\( countdown \)</span> begins with 
   <span class="math-tex">\( n=1 \)</span>, and since n is greater than 0, it outputs the value 1, and then calls itself...&nbsp;
   <br>    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ﻿The execution of 
   <span class="math-tex">\( countdown \)</span> begins with 
   <span class="math-tex">\( n=0 \)</span>, and since n is not greater than 0, it outputs the
   <b></b> word, “Blastoff!” and then &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ﻿returns.
   <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ﻿The 
   <span class="math-tex">\( countdown \)</span> that got 
   <span class="math-tex">\( n=1 \)</span>&nbsp;returns.&nbsp;
   <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;﻿The countdown that got 
   <span class="math-tex">\( n=2 \)</span> returns.&nbsp;
   <br>The countdown that got 
   <span class="math-tex">\( n=3 \)</span> returns.&nbsp;
   <br>
   <br>
  </div>
  <div>
   ﻿And then you’re back in __main__. So, the total output looks like this:&nbsp;
   <br>
   <pre><code class="language-python">3
2
1
Blastoff!</code></pre>
   <p>&nbsp;A function that calls itself is <b>recursive</b>; the process is called <b>recursion</b>.<br></p>
