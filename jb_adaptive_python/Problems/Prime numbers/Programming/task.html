  <p>A positive integer number is called<i>&nbsp;prime</i>, if it has exactly two different dividers, i.e. it can be divided only by one and by itself. <br> For example, number <b>2</b>&nbsp;is prime, as it is divided only by <b>1 </b>and by <b>2</b>. Other examples of prime numbers include <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>31</b>, and infinitely many numbers.<br> Number <b>4</b>, as example, is not prime, because it has three dividers – <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>. Number <b>1</b> is not prime either, as it has only one divider – <b>1</b>.</p> 
  <p>Implement the generator function <b>primes</b>, which will generate prime numbers in ascending order, starting from number <b>2</b>.</p> 
  <p><b>Example use:</b></p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">print(list(itertools.takewhile(lambda x : x &lt;= 31, primes())))
# [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]</code></pre>
