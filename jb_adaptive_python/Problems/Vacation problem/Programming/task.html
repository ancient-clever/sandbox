  <p>Write a Python program to figure out what day you would return, given the day you leave and how many days you will be gone.<br></p> For example: 
  <ul> 
   <li>If you leave on a Friday and you are gone for two (2) days, you would return on a Sunday. </li>
   <li>If you leave on a Monday and you are gone for eight (8) days, you would return on a Tuesday. </li>
   <li>If you leave on a Wednesday and you are gone 23 days, you would return on a Friday. </li>
  </ul> 
  <p> The program should ask for the day to leave and how many days the person will be away. <br></p>
  <p>A sample conversation should look like: </p> 
  <code>What day are you leaving? Wednesday How many days will you be gone? 32 If you left on Wednesday and returned 32 days later, you would return on Sunday</code> 
  <p> One way to attack this problem is convert the days into numbers. For example, 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, and so on until 6 = Saturday. You might use a way to find the remainder to solve the vacation problem.</p>
