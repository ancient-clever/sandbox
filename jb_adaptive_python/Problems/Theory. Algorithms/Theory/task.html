   <p><b>Algorithm</b>&nbsp;is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning ﻿tasks.</p>
   <p>An algorithm is an effective method ﻿that can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time&nbsp;and in a well-defined formal language&nbsp;for calculating a function.<span> ﻿</span>Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),&nbsp;the instructions describe a computation ﻿that, when executed ﻿, proceeds through a finite&nbsp;number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"&nbsp;and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.</p>
   <p><span>﻿There are various ways to classify algorithms:&nbsp;</span><span>by&nbsp;</span><span>﻿implementation,&nbsp;</span><span>﻿by&nbsp;</span><span>design&nbsp;</span><span>paradigm,&nbsp;</span><span>﻿optimization&nbsp;</span><span>problems,&nbsp;</span><span>﻿by&nbsp;</span><span>field&nbsp;</span><span>of&nbsp;</span><span>study,&nbsp;</span><span>﻿by&nbsp;</span><span>complexity^</span></p>﻿See&nbsp;examples&nbsp;﻿and&nbsp;more&nbsp;information:
