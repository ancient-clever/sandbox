  <p>In this problem we will learn how to specify sets of symbols in regular expressions.</p> 
  <p>For this we will use the [ ] wild cards.</p> 
  <p>Inside the square brackets we would be able to list all the characters that we are satisfied with: we can write the pattern "[abc]bc", which will fit the strings abc, bbc, и cbc:</p>
  <pre><code>import re
results = re.findall("[abc]bc", "abc bbc cbc abb")
print(results)</code></pre>
  <p><span>The expression [abc] should be regarded as one symbol, which describes: either a, or b, or с.</span><br></p> 
  <p>Other way to specify a set of symbols is to use the alteration wildcard |.</p> 
  <p>Let us describe a group of characters inside the parentheses and use the alteration character: "(a|b|c)bc"</p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">import re
results = re.findall("(a|b|c)bc", "abc bbc cbc abb")
print(results)</code></pre>
  <p><span>Compared to a set of symbols, specified by the [ ] wildcards, alteration sign can be used for a non-single-character sequences: &nbsp;thus, three strings - "abcx", "abex" and "ddx" will fit for the pattern "(abc|abe|dd)x".</span><br></p> 
  <p>In this problem, you get text on input. By using regular expressions you need to find all the occurrences of the "you" or "You" substring in it and output their quantity.</p>
