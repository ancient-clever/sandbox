  <b></b>Classes are a way of aggregating similar data and functions. A class is basically a scope inside which various code (especially function definitions) is executed, and the locals to this scope become 
  <i>attributes</i>&nbsp;of the class, and of any objects constructed by this class. An object constructed by a class is called an 
  <i>instance</i>&nbsp;of that class.ï»¿
