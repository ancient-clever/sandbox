  <p>The teacher asked Pete to complete homework – in the specified text he had to put emphasis in words, after which she requested Vince to grade Pete's homework. Vince is not very familiar with the topic – that is why he found a dictionary, which indicated where emphasis had to be put in many words. Unfortunately, not all of the words are present in this dictionary. Vince decided that for those words, which were absent in the dictionary, he would grade Pete's solution as correct if a word from Pete had exactly one emphasis.</p> 
  <p>It appeared that in some words emphasis could be placed correctly in more than one way. Vince decided that in the case if Pete put an emphasis in a word and it corresponds to one of the options from the dictionary, he will consider it as the correct placement of emphasis, if not - he will consider it as an error.</p> 
  <p>You are given a dictionary, which Vince used, and the homework made by Pete. You should find the number of errors that Vince will find in Pete's homework.</p> 
  <p><b>Input data</b></p> 
  <p>First input the integer N — the number of words in the dictionary (0 ≤ N ≤ 20000).<br> <br> Next go N lines with words from the dictionary. Each word consists of not more than 30 symbols. All words consist of capital (uppercase) and small (lowercase) letters of the Latin alphabet. Each word contains only one capital letter - the one, on which the emphasis should be made. The words in the dictionary are listed in alphabetical order. If there are multiple emphasis placement possibilities in the same word, then these options in the dictionary are in arbitrary order.<br> <br> Next goes the homework, done by Pete. Homework is a single line of text, having a total length of not more than 300,000 characters. This line consists of words that are separated by exactly one space. The length of each word does not exceed 30 symbols. All words consist of the lowercase and uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet (uppercase are the letters, where Pete put the emphasis). By an error, Pete could put more than one emphasis in a single word or may not put an emphasis at all.</p> 
  <p><b>Output data</b></p> 
  <p>Output the number of errors in the Pete's text, which Vince will find.</p> 
  <p><b>Notes for the examples</b></p> 
  <p>1. According to the dictionary, there are two ways to put emphasis in the word <b>cannot</b>. These options can be listed in the dictionary in any order (i.e. first goes <b>cAnnot</b>, and then goes <b>cannOt</b>, or vice versa).<br> The two errors made by Pete – the words <b>be</b> (he didn't put emphasis) and <b>fouNd</b> (emphasis placed incorrectly). The word <b>thE</b> is not present in the dictionary, but since Pete put exactly one emphasis in it, it is considered correct.</p> 
  <p>2. Incorrectly placed emphasis in all words, except <b>The</b> (it doesn't exist in the dictionary and it contains exactly one emphasis). Other words contain either all emphasis letters (in the word <b>PAGE</b>), or no emphasis at all.</p>
