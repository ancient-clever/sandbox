  <p>Write a program that finds the best solution to a system of linear algebraic equations by the least squares method.</p> 
  <p><b>Input data format:</b><b></b></p> 
  <p>The first string contains two numbers: the number of equations n and number of variables m. The number of equations is not less than the number of variables. Next, go the n lines, each of which contains the m+1 number. First m numbers are the coefficients of the i-th equation of the system, and the last, (m+1)-th number â€“ coefficient <span class="math-tex">\( b_i \)</span>, located in the right part of the i-th equation.</p> 
  <p><b>Output data format:</b><b></b></p> 
  <p>The result should be the system solution in the form of m numbers, separated by a space.</p>
