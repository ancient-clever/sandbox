  <p>You need to write a program that "flips" a sequence of positive integers. On input there is a sequence of space separated positive integers. The sequence ends with zero. You are required to output the sequence in the reverse order. </p> 
  <p>The numbers should be space separated on the output. The terminating zero is simply the indicator of the end of the sequence, it is not a part of it, i.e. you should not output it.</p>
