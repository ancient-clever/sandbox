  <p><b>Swimming pool</b></p> 
  <p>Ian was swimming in the pool having size of NÃ—M feets and got tired. At this moment he realized that he is at a distance of X feets from one of the long ledge (not necessarily from the nearest one) and Y feets from one of the short ledges. What is the minimum distance (in feets) Ian needs to swim in order to reach the swimming pool ledge?</p> 
  <p>The program input contains numbers N, M, X, Y.</p>
