  <p>In this problem, we will deal with the implementation of a group of symbols.</p> 
  <p>We use wildcards "( )" to group symbols. </p> 
  <p>Grouping of characters allows us using repetitions for the sequences: thus, under the pattern "(ab)+" will fit any string like "ababababab...ab".</p> 
  <p>Also, grouping of characters allows us to find interesting substrings inside a large pattern: for example, if we know that somewhere inside the string is a substring "ID: 254", using the pattern "ID: (\d+)" (\d indicates any number) we will be able to find only the number 254 we are interested in:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">import re
string = "ID: 254, ID: 14, ID: 88"
ids = re.findall("ID: (\d+)", string)
print(ids)</code></pre>
  <div>
   <br>
  </div> 
  <p>It is important to understand that the findall function from the re module, returns tuple from all groups, which it found, and if these groups are not listed explicitly, it considers the entire pattern as one group. If we change the pattern to "(ID: (\d+))", the function will return tuples with two elements: the whole pattern and its digital ID.</p>
  <pre><pre><code class="language-python">import re
string = "ID: 254, ID: 14, ID: 88"
ids = re.findall("(ID: (\d+))", string)
print(ids)</code></pre><br></pre>
  <p>NB. It is important to understand that the groups will be listed inside the tuple in the order of their occurrence in the pattern. (In the order, in which occur the opening brackets, corresponding to the groups)</p> 
  <p>In this problem Python code is served as input. Your task is to find all the assignments in the code and to output where they occurred, and the value of what variable they changed!</p> 
  <p>Please remember that according to the PEP8 standard, the operation of assignment (in contrast to the transfer of an argument) is separated by a single space from both sides. Thus, as a valid assignment we consider if (something, consisting of only letters, numbers and lowerspace) = (something). In this problem we believe that there may be only one assignment of only one variable per line.</p> 
  <p>For each assignment you need to output on a separate line â€“ the line number (lines are numbered from one) and the name of the variable, value of which has been changed. The line numbers must be in ascending order.</p>
