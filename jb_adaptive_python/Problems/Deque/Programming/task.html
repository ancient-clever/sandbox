   <p>Implement the deque with dynamic looped buffer.</p> 
   <p>Commands are given as input in order to test the deque. </p> 
   <p>The first line contains the number of commands. Then each line contains one command. <b></b></p> 
   <p>Each command is specified as 2 integer numbers: a b.</p> 
   <p>a = 1 - push front,<br> a = 2 - pop front,<br> a = 3 - push back, <br> a = 4 - pop back.</p> 
   <p>If given command is pop, then the number b is expected value. If the pop command is called for an empty deque, then “-1” is expected.</p> 
   <p>You should output YES if all the expected values matched. Otherwise, if at least one expectation was not met, then output NO.асбтрас</p>
