  <p><b>Phoebe Iterson</b></p> 
  <p>In this problem, you have to write the <b>fibonacci_sequence</b> class, from which we can take the iterator, which will sort numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.</p> 
  <p>The Fibonacci sequence is defined like below. The first two of its elements are equal to <b>1</b>, and each of the next elements is equal to the sum of two previous ones. The beginning of this sequence looks like the following:<br> <b></b></p>
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">1
1
2&nbsp;(1 + 1)
3&nbsp;(2 + 1)
5&nbsp;(3 + 2)
8&nbsp;(5 + 3)
13&nbsp;(8 + 5)
...</code></pre> 
  <p>The <b>fibonacci_sequence</b>&nbsp;class must have the constructor with one argument - the length of the sorted Fibonacci sequence.</p> 
  <p>Thus, <b>iter(fibonacci_sequence(5))</b> should correspond to the iterator, which displays the first five numbers from the Fibonacci sequence each after each, and in case of attempts to obtain the next number after all the five numbers were displayed, an exception <b>StopIteration</b> should be thrown.</p>
