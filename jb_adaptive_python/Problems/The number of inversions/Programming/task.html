  <p><b>The number of inversions</b></p> 
  <p>First line contains number <span class="math-tex">\( 1 \le n \le 10^5 \)</span>, second one â€” array <span class="math-tex">\( A[1\ldots n] \)</span>, containing natural numbers not greater than <span class="math-tex">\( 10^9 \)</span>. You need to calculate the number of pairs of indices <span class="math-tex">\( 1 \le i \lt j \le n \)</span>, for which <span class="math-tex">\( A[i] \gt A[j] \)</span>. (Such pair of elements is called the inversion. The number of inversion in the array is in some way its measure of random nature: for example, there are no inversions at all in an array arranged in a nondecreasing order, and in an array, arranged in descending order, each two elements form an inversion.)</p>
