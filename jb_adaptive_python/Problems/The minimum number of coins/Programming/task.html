  <p>Each square of the rectangular table <span class="math-tex">\( N \times M \)</span> contains some number. </p> 
  <p>Initially the player is located in the top left square. </p> 
  <p>In one move he is allowed to move to the neighbouring cell either to the right or down (left and upward moves are not permitted). When passing through a square the player pays that amount of coins, which is written in this square (he must also pay coins for the first and for the last squares of his path).</p> 
  <p>You need to find the minimum number of coins, which the player needs to take in order to get to the bottom right corner.</p> 
  <p>First line has the two numbers <span class="math-tex">\( N \)</span> и <span class="math-tex">\( M \)</span> — the size of the table (<span class="math-tex">\( 1 \le N \le 20 \)</span>, <span class="math-tex">\( 1 \le M \le 20 \)</span>).<br> Next go <span class="math-tex">\( N \)</span> lines having <span class="math-tex">\( M \)</span> numbers in each — the number of coins to pass through the corresponding squares (integers from 0 to 100).</p>
