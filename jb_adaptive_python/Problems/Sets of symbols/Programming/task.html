  <p><b>Sets of symbols</b></p> 
  <p>In this problem, we will learn to specify sets of symbols.</p> 
  <p>To do this we use the wildcards <b>[ ]</b>.</p> 
  <p>Inside the brackets we can list all the characters that suit us: we can write a regular expression "<b>[abc]bc</b>", which will fit the strings <b>abc</b>, <b>bbc</b>, and <b>cbc</b>:</p>
  <pre><code>import re
results = re.findall("[abc]bc", "abc bbc cbc abb")
print(results)</code></pre>
  <p><br>Entry <b>[abc]</b> should be considered as a single symbol, which describes: either <b>a</b>, or <b>b</b>, or <b>с</b>.</p> 
  <p>The other way to define a set of symbols is the alteration wildcard <b>|</b>.</p> 
  <p>Let’s describe a group of symbols inside the parentheses, and use the alteration symbol: "<b>(a|b|c)bc</b>"</p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">import re
results = re.findall("(a|b|c)bc", "abc bbc cbc abb")
print(results)</code></pre>
  <p><br>Unlike a set of symbols specified by the wildcards [ ], the alteration sign can be used for non-single-symbol sequences: &nbsp;the pattern "<b>(abc|abe|dd)x</b>" this way will fit the three lines – "<b>abcx</b>", "<b>abex</b>" and "<b>ddx</b>".<br></p> 
  <p>In this problem, you get text as input. By using regular expressions you should find all occurrences of the "<b>you</b>" or "<b>You</b>" in it and output the number of occurrences.</p>
