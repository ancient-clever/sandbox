  <p><b><span class="math-tex">\( \)</span>Parity</b> is a mathematical term that describes the property of an integer's inclusion in one of two categories: <b>even</b> or <b>odd</b>. An integer is even if it is 'evenly divisible' by two (the old-fashioned term "evenly divisible" is now almost always shortened to "divisible") and odd if it is not even. For example, 6 is even because there is no remainder when dividing it by 2. By contrast, 3, 5, 7, 21 leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Examples of even numbers include −4, 0, 8, and 1738. In particular, zero is an even number. Some examples of odd numbers are −5, 3, 9, and 73. Parity does not apply to non-integer numbers.<br><br></p>
  <p>The sets&nbsp;of even and odd numbers can be defined as following:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Even</b>&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\( = \{2k : k \in \mathbb {Z}\} \)</span>&nbsp;</li>
   <li><b>Odd</b>&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\( = \{2k+1:k∈ℤ\} \)</span>&nbsp;</li>
