  <p><b>Checksums</b> – the small values computed from the relatively large amounts of data, in order to ensure its consistency – i.e. to check that the data was not accidentally damaged, changed or partially lost.</p> 
  <p>Given an array, you need to calculate its checksum. This should be done as follows: each element (starting from the first one) is added to the current result (starting from 0); the resulting amount is multiplied by <code>113</code>, then take the remainder by modulo <code>10000007</code> – this will be the new value of the result, and so on.</p> 
  <p><b>Input data</b> contains the length of the array in the first line.<br> Elements of the array follow in the second line, space separated.</p> 
  <p><b>The output</b> should contain a single number – the resulting checksum.</p>
