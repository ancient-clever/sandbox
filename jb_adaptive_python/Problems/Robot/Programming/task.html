  <p><b>Robot</b></p> 
  <p>The robot moves down the office in the Bioinformatics Institute. Recently, students from the programmers group wrote a program for this robot, according to which when robot enters the room, he counts the number of programmers present in this room and says it aloud: "n programmers".</p> 
  <p>In order for it to sound correctly, for each <span class="math-tex">\( n \)</span> you need to use the correct word ending.</p> 
  <p>Write a program, reading an integer <span class="math-tex">\( n \)</span> (non-negative one) from the user input, outputting this number together with the correctly changed word "programmer", so that the robot could correctly communicate with people, for example: 1 programmer, 2 programmers, 5 programmers.</p> 
  <p>There can be many programmers in one room. Make sure that your program works correctly for all the cases until 1000 persons</p>
