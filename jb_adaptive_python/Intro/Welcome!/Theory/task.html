  <p>Welcome to the Adaptive Python course!</p>
  <p>Here we've collected few hundreds of programming assignments for Python, ranging from basics up to complex topics.<br></p>
  <p>Right now we are developing an adaptive learning engine which chooses content for each learner individually&nbsp;–&nbsp;by her level and knowledge gaps. In this course you can try out the first prototype of this engine.<br></p>
  <p>To enable adaptive mode, you need to go to <a href="/course/Adaptive-Python-568/adaptive" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://stepic.org/course/Adaptive-Python-568/adaptive</a>. Adaptive controls will be located on the top and will look like this:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" class="image-fullsize" src="https://ucarecdn.com/b8d55066-65bc-4e5b-9915-08fc769f5bdf/" title="Image: https://ucarecdn.com/b8d55066-65bc-4e5b-9915-08fc769f5bdf/"></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The first button becomes active only after you successfully solve the problem. If the problem seems too difficult or too easy, you can click on one of the buttons on the right, the engine will take into account your knowledge level for future content recommendations.</p>
  <p>If you want to take a break, you can always go back to the adaptive mode using the same link (<a href="/course/Adaptive-Python-568/adaptive" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://stepic.org/course/Adaptive-Python-568/adaptive</a>).<br><br>We would be happy to&nbsp;﻿get your feedback on this adaptive system! You can write to us in the comments section ﻿below this&nbsp;text&nbsp;﻿↓ and also&nbsp;﻿below&nbsp;each&nbsp;problem.<br><br>Enjoy and good&nbsp;luck!<br><br>P.S. Initially, the ﻿adaptive system may behave somewhat randomly, but the more problems you solve, the smarter it become!</p>
